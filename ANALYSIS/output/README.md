# Output Directory

This directory should contain constructed data files that have been produced by scripts that I have run. This includes modifications made to the original raw data by recoding, aggregating, subsetting, and other data cleaning operations. 

It should be possible to delete all of the contents in this directory and re-run the scripts used to construct them from the raw data to reproduce the files exactly. If that is not possible, then you are not doing it right. 

This README will be removed when your run the `run_entire_project.sh`. It is assumed that any documentation on constructed dataset is not kept here.
