# Introduction
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

Use this R Markdown to perform the main analysis for the project. I use this basically as a lab notebook. It contains the main analysis and a variety of sensitivity analysis. The code in this documents serves as a baseline for the eventual tables and figures that will go into the paper. At the same time it will serve as a record of all supplementary analyses performed.
