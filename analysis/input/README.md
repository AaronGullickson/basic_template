# Input Directory

This directory should contain unedited data files directly from the source. I typically put different data sources into different sub-directories and include any relevant data documentation in the same directory. 

Following the guidelines of [Code and Data](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml#magicparlabel-270), this directory is dedicated to raw data from other sources ONLY. Datasets in this input directory should NEVER be edited. If newer data extracts are used, older raw data should just be replaced and changes commmitted. Constructed datasets should NEVER be placed in this directory.
