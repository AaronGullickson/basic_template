# products Directory

This directory contains resources and starter code for producing papers and presentations related to the research. I usually create a manin project.bib from Zotero that goes in this directory and auto-updates from within Zotero. Here is a brief overview of the remaining directories. 

- `paper` This directory contains starter R Markdown files for creating a manuscript, including a separate main document, tables & figures, and appendices. It also contains a python script to put it all together into a single file.
- `presentation` Some starter slides for a presentation using [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).
- `poster` Some starter code for creating a poster using [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown).
- `submissions` This contains files related to actual submission of material to journals. 
- `webpage` A basic template for creating a [distill article](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) as a webpage.
