# products Directory

This directory contains resources and starter code for producing papers and presentations related to the research. I usually create a manin project.bib from Zotero that goes in this directory and auto-updates from within Zotero. Here is a brief overview of the remaining directories. 

- `paper` This directory contains starter R Markdown files for creating a manuscript, including a separate main document, tables & figures, and appendices. It also contains a python script to put it all together into a single file.
- `presentation` Nothing here yet, but ultimately this will include some starter R Markdown code for creating a presentation using ioslides.
- `submissions` This contains files related to actual submission of material to journals.
