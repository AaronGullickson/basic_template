This directory contains some starter code in an R Markdown file to create a presentation using ioslides. It also contains some custom css for this presentation. The presentation can be knitted to an HTML file. To present, simply open the HTML file in a browser and hit `f` for full-screen display. Hit `p` to get a presenter's view. 

The provided R Markdown file shows how to display a figure with high resolution and transparency. You can adjust the size of a figure to fit a particular slide, but you should remember to adjust both the fig.height/fig.width settings and the out.height/out.width settings to ensure proper resolution and scaling. 

The CSS provides a special class for displaying stargazer/htmlreg tables nicely as well as a class for footers.
