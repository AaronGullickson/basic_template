This directory contains some starter code in an R Markdown file to create a presentation using [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). It also contains some custom css for this presentation. The presentation can be knitted to an HTML file. 

The CSS provides a special class for displaying texreg tables nicely as well as a class for footers.
