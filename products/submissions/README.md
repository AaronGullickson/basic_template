# Submissions Directory

This directory contains actual manuscripts and other information (e.g. cover pages, correspondence) for specific submission to journals. The manuscripts may have some post-processing touch-up applied to meet various specific journal formatting rules. 

Each journal is given a separate sub-directory and then I use separate sub-directories within each of these directories to separate initial submissions from R&Rs.
